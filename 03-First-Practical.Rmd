# Eskdale I - Introduction {#FirstPractical}

It should be evident from the lectures that digital elevation models (DEMs) have a great deal of potential for modelling surface water hydrology and related phenomena in drainage basins. Much of this work is based on the assumptions that (1) we can trace the path that water will take from any point in an elevation grid to a basin outlet, and (2) the discharge of water from a particular location is directly related to its catchment area. This is a fairly reasonable assumption in most drainage basins. 

## Overview

In this lab exercise, we will use a DEM of the Upper Eskdale catchment to model flow-related phenomena, and will have gained experience in:

- DEM pre-processing; 
- Calculating flow parameters (e.g. pointers and contributing areas);
- Comparing flow algorithms.

### Intended learning outcomes

In [Chapter 5](#Eskdale_set_up), we'll download the data and install the required programs and packages, and will combine these in [Chapter 6](#Eskdale_flow_algorithms) to: 

- gain experience with [WhiteboxTools](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html), a specialist GIS specifically designed for digital terrain analysis (DTA); 
- become familiar with some of the most commonly used flow algorithms used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs); 
- consider the utility of DTA for routing applications; 

### Assessment

This practical is formative and as such will not count towards your final mark for GEOGz70581, but you are encouraged to complete the practical to the best of your ability, and to have one or more attempts at the formative quiz. 

### Quiz

There is an on-line Blackboard quiz associated with this practical that you are encouraged to complete. The quiz can be found on Blackboard under Course Content â†’ [Week 8 to 12](https://online.manchester.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_13304460_1&course_id=_68533_1). The quiz consists of six questions. You can have multiple attempts at the quiz.
