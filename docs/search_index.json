[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Practical outline", " Hydrological analysis in R Chapter 1 Introduction It should be evident from the lectures that digital elevation models (DEMs) have a great deal of potential for modelling surface water hydrology and related phenomena in drainage basins. Much of this work is based on the assumptions that (1) we can trace the path that water will take from any point in an elevation grid to a basin outlet, and (2) the discharge of water from a particular location is directly related to its catchment area. This is a fairly reasonable assumption in most drainage basins. 1.1 Practical outline In this set of practicals, well be using R, RStudio and WhiteboxTools to perform hydrological analysis. In Chapters 2 and 3, well install and get to grips with the required programs. In Practical 1, well introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. In Practical 2, well utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the Mersey Basin Chapter 5. This forms the basis for your assessment. In this lab exercise, we will use a DEM of the Upper Eskdale watershed to model flow-related phenomena. Upper Eskdale catchment In this exercise you will gain experience in the following: DEM pre-processing; Calculating flow parameters: Pointers and contributing area; Comparing flow algorithms.

This programme has much of the functionality found in a standard GIS software package, but it has a number of useful features specific to hydrological analysis, and it is relatively easy to install, with small file sizes. Test picture Whitebox can be freely installed on a personal computer (https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/Whitebox/) although this requires ~100 Mb of disk storage to install. In addition, as Whitebox utilises the Java platform, your computer will need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8.0 or higher installed and operating. You can check your Java version using command prompt (see below) and by typing java -version. If you JRE version is less than 8.0 (e.g. java version 1.6.0), you can update it here: https://www.java.com/en/download/. 2.1 R To Install R: Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org. Click the download R link in the middle of the page under Getting Started. Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link. Click on the Download R for Windows link. Click on base and then Download R Version Number for Windows (Current is 4.1.1) Click on the file containing the latest version of R under Files. Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 2.2 R Studio To Install RStudio: Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the Download RStudio button. Click on Download RStudio Desktop. Click on the version recommended for your system, save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it to open, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder. 2.3 Whitebox Tools To Install WBT: 2.4 Using R packages Heres the packages well be using: Raster Sp ggplot2  2.5 Course materials All the data required for this sets of practicals is available on Blackboard or can be downloaded here: "],["Intro_to_R.html", "Chapter 3 A (brief) introduction to R 3.1 Why code? 3.2 Heres how to use R 3.3 Assigning variables 3.4 Data types 3.5 Vectors 3.6 Loading data", " Chapter 3 A (brief) introduction to R How to use R. 3.1 Why code?
