[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Practical outline 1.2 Objectives 1.3 Schedule", " Hydrological analysis in R Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Practical outline In this set of practicals, well be using R, RStudio and WhiteboxTools to perform hydrological analysis. In Chapters 2 and 3, well install and get to grips with the required programs. In Practical 1 (Chapters 4 - 6), which uses data for the Eskdale watershed, well introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. In Practical 2 (Chapters 7 - 11), well utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the Mersey Basin. This forms the basis for your assessment. Note: the relevant chapters will be made available as we progress through the semester, hence why Practicals 2 and the assessment information are not currently visible. Practical 2 will be released prior to the Week 10 lecture. 1.2 Objectives After completing these practicals, you will: have gained experience with new tools (e.g. R, RStudio, WhiteboxTools); become familiar with hydrological approaches used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs); utilised statistical analysis to investigate the relationships between water quality indicators and catchment characteristics; improved your understanding of the hydrological processes influencing water quality. 1.3 Schedule These practicals will be completed across Weeks 8 to 12 as follows: Week 8: Introductory lecture (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 1 - 3: An introduction to R (~1 hr) Weeks 9: Lecture on Hydrological and Geomorphological models (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 4 - 6: Eskdale practical (~2 hr) Weeks 10 - 12: Lecture on Water Quality Modelling (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 7 - 11: Mersey practical (~8 hr) The assessment, based upon Practical 2 (Mersey), is due 05/01/2023 (14:00). "],["Installation.html", "Chapter 2 Installation 2.1 R 2.2 R Studio 2.3 Course materials", " Chapter 2 Installation During this practical you will be using WhiteboxTools, an open-source GIS software package for hydro-geomorphic applications. While it contains much of the functionality found in a standard GIS software package, it also includes novel functionality specific to hydrological analysis. The tools are also computationally efficient (i.e. fast!), taking advantage of parallel processing and other advancements in computing power. Finally, the tools are developed for cross-platform use, so can be accessed through code (e.g. R, Python) or other GUIs (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS) if required. To run WhiteboxTools functions (WBT), well be using R as a front-end interface. This will allow us to access and run all of the relevant hydrological functions from WBT, while utilising the statistical and visualisation capabilities of R. 2.1 R If youre working on a university-managed computer (in HBS 2.2, HBS 2.88 or Mansfield Cooper 2.01) or accessing the course via Citrix, both R and RStudio (described below) should already be installed or can be accessed through the Software Centre. To Install R on a personal computer: Open an internet browser and go to https://www.r-project.org/. Click the download R link in the middle of the page under Getting Started. Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link e.g. the site provided by Imperial College London. Click on the Download R for Windows link, or the relevant link for your operating system (macOS, Linux). Click on base and then Download R [Version Number] for Windows. The current version is 4.2.2. Once downloaded, double click the application file (.exe) and follow the installation instructions. 2.2 R Studio While R is now installed, it is good practice to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to access and run R functions. The most well known IDE for R is RStudio, which includes a console, higher quality graphics, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Note: R may be used without RStudio, but RStudio cannot be used without R. To Install RStudio on a personal computer: Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and click on Download RStudio for Windows. Installers for macOS and other operating systems are available below. Once downloaded, double click the application file (.exe) and follow the installation instructions. 2.3 Course materials All the data required for this sets of practicals are available on Blackboard under Course Content  Week 8 to 12. Download the folder, save it to an appropriate location and extract the contents (unzip). The directory structure is as follows: GEOG70581 Data Practical_1 Practical_2 Images Practical_1 Practical_2 Output Practical_1 Practical_2 All the required data files for Practicals 1 and 2 are stored in the associated sub-directory within Data. As we move through the practicals, well be creating a number of additional GIS files and we encourage you to save these within the corresponding sub-directory within Output. Finally, maps and figures will be required for the assessment. These can be exported directly from R and stored in Images.
