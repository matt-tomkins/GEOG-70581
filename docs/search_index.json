In Chapters 2 and 3, well install and get to grips with the required programs. In Practical 1 (Chapters 4 - 6), which uses data for the Eskdale watershed, well introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. In Practical 2 (Chapters 7 - 11), well utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the Mersey Basin. This forms the basis for your assessment. Note: the relevant chapters will be made available as we progress through the semester, hence why Practicals 2 and the assessment information are not currently visible. Practical 2 will be released prior to the Week 10 lecture. 1.2 Objectives After completing these practicals, you will: have gained experience with new tools (e.g. R, RStudio, WhiteboxTools); become familiar with hydrological approaches used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs); utilised statistical analysis to investigate the relationships between water quality indicators and catchment characteristics; improved your understanding of the hydrological processes influencing water quality. 1.3 Schedule These practicals will be completed across Weeks 8 to 12 as follows: Week 8: Introductory lecture (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 1 - 3: An introduction to R (~2 hr) Weeks 9: Lecture on Hydrological and Geomorphological models (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 4 - 6: Eskdale practical (~2 hr, plus independent work) Weeks 10 - 12: Lecture on Water Quality Modelling (~1 hr) Complete Chapters 7 - 11: Mersey practical (~6 hr, plus independent work) The assessment, based upon Practical 2 (Mersey), is due 11/01/2024 (14:00).
