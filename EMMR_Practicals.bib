	abstract = {Software tools have been developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center to extract topographic structure and to delineate watersheds and overland flow paths from digital elevation models. The tools are specialpurpose FORTRAN programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original OEM with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal to the total number of cells that drain to it. The original OEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for userspecified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for futher analysis. Comparisons between these computergenerated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing.},

	abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time‐consuming. With the growing availability of high‐resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS‐based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high‐resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least‐cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C++ programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time.},

	abstract = {The usual numerical methods for removing the depressions of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) gradually fill the depressions and merge the embedded ones. These methods are complex to implement and need large computation time, particularly when the DEM contains a high proportion of random noise. A new method is presented here. It is innovative because, instead of gradually filling the depressions, it first inundates the surface with a thick layer of water and then removes the excess water. The algorithm is simple to understand and to implement, requiring only a few tens of code lines. It is much faster than usual algorithms. Moreover, this method is versatile: depressions can be replaced with a surface either strictly horizontal, or slightly sloping. The first option is used for the calculation of depression storage capacity and the second one for drainage network extraction. The method is fully detailed and a pseudo-code is provided. Its practical computation time, evaluated on generated fractal surfaces, is asymptotically proportional to N1.2 where N is the number of grid points. The theoretical computation time is asymptotically proportional to N1.5 in all cases, with the exception of some exotic ones with no practical interest. By contrast, existing methods have a computation time asymptotically proportional to N2. Applications are done for both generated and measured surfaces with 256 cells to 6.2 million cells.},

	abstract = {Interpreters of reflection seismic data generally use images to disseminate the outcomes of their geologic interpretation work. The presentation of such interpretation images can generate unwanted biases in the perception of the observers, an effect known as “framing bias.” These framing biases can enhance or reduce the confidence of the observer in the presented interpretation, independently of the quality of the seismic data or the geologic interpretation. We have tested the effect of presentation on confidence in interpretation of 761 participants of an online experiment. Experiment participants were presented with seismic images and interpretations, deliberately modified in different aspects to introduce potential framing biases. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the image presentation had a subdued effect on participants’ confidence compared with the quality of the seismic data and interpretation. The results allow us to propose recommendations to minimize biases in the observers related to the presentation of seismic interpretations: (1) interpretations should be shown with the seismic data in the background to ease comparison between the uninterpreted-interpreted data and the subsequent confidence assessments; (2) seismic data displayed in color aids in the interpretation, although the color palettes must be carefully chosen to prevent unwanted bias from common color spectrum in the observers; and (3) explicit indication of uncertainty by the interpreters in their own interpretation, which was deemed useful by the participants.},

Their underlying, increasingly elaborate numerical codes produce a growing amount of raw data. Post-processing such data is therefore becoming more and more important, but also more challenging and time-consuming. In addition, visualising processed data and results has, in times of coloured figures and a wealth of half-scientific software, become one of the weakest pillars of science, widely mistreated and ignored. Efficient and automated geodynamic diagnostics and sensible scientific visualisation preventing common pitfalls is thus more important than ever. Here, a collection of numerous diagnostics for plate tectonics and mantle dynamics is provided and a case for truly scientific visualisation is made. Amongst other diagnostics are a most accurate and robust plate-boundary identification, slab-polarity recognition, plate-bending derivation, surface-topography component splitting and mantle-plume detection. Thanks to powerful image processing tools and other elaborate algorithms, these and many other insightful diagnostics are conveniently derived from only a subset of the most basic parameter fields.

	abstract = {Topographic indices may be used to attempt to approximate the likely distribution of variable source areas within a catchment. One such index has been applied widely using the distribution function catchment model, TOPMODEL, of Beven and Kirkby (1979). Validation of the spatial predictions of TOPMODEL may be affected by the algorithm used to calculate the model's topographic index. A number of digital terrain analysis (DTA) methods are therefore described for use in calculating the TOPMODEL topographic index, In(a/tanβ) (a = upslope contributing area per unit contour; tanβ = local slope angle). The spatial pattern and statistical distribution of the index is shown to be substantially different for different calculation procedures and differing pixel resolutions. It is shown that an interaction between hillslope contributing area accumulation and the analytical definition of the channel network has a major influence on calculated In(a/tanβ) index patterns. A number of DTA tests were performed to explore this interaction. The tests suggested that an ‘optimum’ channel initiation threshold (CIT) may be identified for positioning river headwaters in a raster digital terrain model (DTM). This threshold was found to be dependent on DTM grid resolution. Grid resolution is also suggested to have implications for the validation of spatial model predictions, implying that ‘optimum’ TOPMODEL parameter sets may be unique to the grid scale used in their derivation. Combining existing DTA procedures with an identified CIT, a procedure is described to vary the directional diffusion of contributing area accumulation with distance from the channel network.},

This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion).

Here we report on a new flow routing algorithm and compare it to three common classes of algorithms currently in widespread use. The advantage of the new algorithm is that unrealistic dispersion on planar or concave hillslopes is avoided, whereas multiple flow directions are allowed on convex hillslopes. We suggest that this new triangular multiple flow direction algorithm (MD∞) is more appropriate for a range of flow routing and topographic index applications.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in assessing riparian zones and their hydrological and biogeochemical buffering capacity with indices derived from hydrologic landscape analysis of digital elevation data. Upslope contributing area is a common surrogate for lateral water flows and can be used to assess the variability of local water inflows to riparian zones and streams. However, current geographic information system algorithms do not provide a method for easily separating riparian zone and adjacent upland lateral contributions on each side of the stream. Here we propose a new algorithm to compute side-separated contributions along stream networks. We describe the new algorithm and illustrate the importance of distinguishing between lateral inflows on each side of streams with hillslope–riparian zone–stream hydrologic connectivity results from high-frequency water table data collected in the 22 km2 Tenderfoot Creek catchment, Montana.},

	abstract = {Current algorithms that deduce the drainage network from a digital elevation model (DEM) represented by a regular array of surface elevations share a fault: Unless the terrain is rugged, the derived water channels tend to flow in parallel lines along preferred directions engendered by the sampling grid orientation. We present a simple solution to the problem. A second difficulty is the presence of noise that creates artificial pits. We briefly describe a method which deals with pits in what we believe to be a more efficient manner for virtual memory environments than previous efforts. Our system has treated DEMs of nearly 9,000,000 pixels. We show how depth first search of the resulting drainage network permits segmentation of the DEM into basins by various criteria, analysis of stream-sediment anomaly dilution profiles, improved hydrological models and other applications.},

	abstract = {Outlet point positions taken from hydrometric stations commonly do not coincide with stream locations extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs). This is a serious problem for accurate watershed delineation of data sets containing numerous outlets, which is critical in regional-scale studies that relate catchment characteristics to basin responses. The advanced outlet repositioning approach (AORA), presented here, replicates the processes involved in manual outlet placement while reducing inefficiency and potential for blunders. The technique uses water body names to identify locations for outlet repositioning that are consistent with nearby outlets. The AORA performance was compared against two existing automated techniques using 993 stations in seven basins in northwest England. The AORA had the fewest repositioning errors in each basin and nearly halved the overall number of errors in the data set, compared with the second-best method. This work highlights the potential errors that may be present in studies that have employed existing automated watershed mapping methods.},

	abstract = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

This article considers why 5\% may be set as a reasonable cut-off for statistical significance, explains the correct interpretation of P {\textless} 0.05 and other values of P, examines arguments for and against the concept of statistical significance, and suggests other and better ways for analyzing data and for presenting, interpreting, and discussing the results.},
