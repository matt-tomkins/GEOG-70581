# Assessment {#Assessment}

All the important information related to Assessment 2 is available on **Canvas** [here](https://canvas.manchester.ac.uk/courses/40307/pages/assessment-guidance?module_item_id=2105254) as a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth), rather than being replicated here. 

This includes aims, assessment criteria and rubrics, formatting instructions (e.g., word count, referencing), and advice on structure and potential points of discussion. 

While this is an independent piece of work, there is lots of support available. You can:

- talk to Matt or the TAs during class time.
- use the [A2 discussion forum](https://canvas.manchester.ac.uk/courses/40307/discussion_topics/622642). 
- attend weekly student consultation hours (in-person or online), listed on the [Student Support Hours Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13qn5XeNFJpQu0XENSjNV8yy1LPbzrZHTYnCfE58_7FY/edit?gid=1879212219#gid=1879212219).
- contact the teaching team via [email](https://canvas.manchester.ac.uk/courses/40307), although we strongly encourage students to make use of the forum, as the visible repository of question-answers is beneficial to the entire student cohort, unlike a private email exchange.   
- make use of departmental GIS support (`GISTechnical@manchester.ac.uk`).
