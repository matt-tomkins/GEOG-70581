# Introduction

![](figures/course-logo.png) 

## Practical outline

In this set of practicals, we'll be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [WhiteboxTools](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html) to perform hydrological analysis. 

In [Chapters 2](#Installation) and [3](#R), we'll install and get to grips with the required programs. 

In Practical 1 (Chapters 4 - 6), which uses data for the **Eskdale** watershed, we'll introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. 

In Practical 2 (Chapters 7 - 11),  we'll utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the **Mersey** Basin. This forms the basis for your assessment. 

The relevant chapters will be made available as the weeks progress. The assessed practical and assessment guidance will be released prior to our session in Week 10. 

## Objectives

After completing these practicals, you will:

- have gained experience with new tools (e.g. R, RStudio, WhiteboxTools);
- become familiar with hydrological approaches used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs);
- utilised statistical analysis to investigate the relationships between water quality indicators and catchment characteristics; 
- improved your understanding of the hydrological processes influencing water quality.

## Schedule

These practicals will be completed across Weeks 8 to 12 as follows:

- Week 8: 
  - Lecture on Hydrological and Geomorphological models (~1 hr)
  - Complete Chapters 1 - 3 (~2 hr)
- Weeks 9:
  - Water Quality Modelling introduction lecture (< 1 hr)
  - Complete **Eskdale** practical, covered in Chapters 4 - 6 (~2-3 hr)
- Weeks 10 - 12:
  - Complete **Mersey** practical, covered in Chapters 7 - 11 (~9 hr)
  
  
The assessment, based upon Practical 2 (**Mersey**), is due 06/01/2022 (14:00).
