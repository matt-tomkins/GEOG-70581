# Introduction

![](figures/course-logo.png) 

## Practical outline

In this set of practicals, we'll be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [WhiteboxTools](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html) to perform hydrological analysis. 

In [Chapters 2](#Installation) and [3](#R), we'll install and get to grips with the required programs. 

In Practical 1 (Chapters 4 - 6), which uses data for the **Eskdale** watershed, we'll introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. 

In Practical 2 (Chapters 7 - 11),  we'll utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the **Mersey** Basin. This forms the basis for your assessment. 

**Note**: the relevant chapters will be made available as we progress through the semester, hence why Practicals 2 and the assessment information are not currently visible. Practical 2 will be released prior to the Week 10 lecture.

## Objectives

After completing these practicals, you will:

- have gained experience with new tools (e.g. R, RStudio, WhiteboxTools);
- become familiar with hydrological approaches used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs);
- utilised statistical analysis to investigate the relationships between water quality indicators and catchment characteristics; 
- improved your understanding of the hydrological processes influencing water quality.

## Schedule

These practicals will be completed across Weeks 8 to 12 as follows:

- Week 8: 
  - Introductory lecture (~1 hr)
  - Complete Chapters 1 - 3: An introduction to R (~2 hr)
- Weeks 9:
  - Lecture on Hydrological and Geomorphological models (~1 hr)
  - Complete Chapters 4 - 6: **Eskdale** practical (~2 hr)
- Weeks 10 - 12:
  - Lecture on Water Quality Modelling (~1 hr)
  - Complete Chapters 7 - 11: **Mersey** practical (~9 hr)
  
  
The assessment, based upon Practical 2 (**Mersey**), is due XX/XX/XXXX (14:00).
