# Introduction

![](figures/course-logo.png) 

## Practical outline

In this set of practicals, we'll be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [WhiteboxTools](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html) to perform hydrological analysis. 

In [Chapters 2](#Installation) and [3](#R), we'll install and get to grips with the required programs. 

In [Practical 1](#FirstPractical) (Chapters 4 - 6), which uses data for the **Eskdale** watershed, we'll introduce you to some of the key approaches, including DEM pre-processing, calculating flow parameters and comparing flow algorithms. 

In [Practical 2](#SecondPractical) (Chapters 7 - X),  we'll utilise these approaches to investigate the water quality of the **Mersey** Basin. This forms the basis for your [assessment](#Assessment). 

## Objectives

After completing these practicals, you will:

- have gained experience with new tools (e.g. R, RStudio, WhiteboxTools);
- become familiar with hydrological approaches used to simulate overland flow from digital elevation models (DEMs);
- utilised statistical analysis to investigate the relationships between water quality indicators and catchment characteristics; 
- improved your understanding of the hydrological processes influencing water quality.

## Schedule

These practicals will be completed across Weeks 8 to 12 as follows:

- Week 8: 
  - Lecture on Hydrological and Geomorphological models (~1 hr)
  - Complete Chapters 1 - 3 (~2 hr)
- Weeks 9 and 10:
  - Water Quality Modelling introduction lecture (~1 hr)
  - Complete **Eskdale** practical, covered in Chapters 4 - 6 (~5 hr)
- Weeks 11 and 12:
  - Complete **Mersey** practical, covered in Chapters 7 - X (~6 hr)
