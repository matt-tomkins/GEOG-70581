# Eskdale **2** - Set-up {#Eskdale_set_up}

## Install programs

If you haven't installed R and RStudio, please refer to the instructions [here](#Installation) before continuing. 

## Download data {#download_data}

The data for this practical can be downloaded [here](XXXX). 

> Download the folder, save it to an appropriate location and extract the contents (unzip). 

The directory structure is as follows:

- Data 
    - Practical_1
    - Practical_2
- Images 
    - Practical_1
    - Practical_2
- Output
    - Practical_1
    - Practical_2
    
All the required data files for Practicals 1 and 2 are stored in the associated sub-directory within **Data**. 

As we move through the practicals, we'll be creating a number of additional GIS files and we encourage you to save these within the corresponding sub-directory within **Output**. 

Finally, maps and figures will be required for the assessment. These can be exported directly from R and stored in **Images**. 

## Open RStudio
