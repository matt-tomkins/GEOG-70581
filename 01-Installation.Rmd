During this practical you will be using [WhiteboxTools](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html), an open-source GIS software package for hydro-geomorphic applications. While it contains much of the functionality found in a standard GIS software package, it also includes novel functionality specific to hydrological analysis. The tools are also computationally efficient (i.e. fast!), taking advantage of parallel processing and other advancements in computing power. Finally, the tools are developed for cross-platform use, so can be accessed through code (e.g. R, Python) or other GUIs (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS) if required. 

To run WhiteboxTools functions (**WBT**), we'll be using R as a front-end interface. This will allow us to access and run all of the relevant hydrological functions from WBT, while utilising the statistical and visualisation capabilities of R. 

## R

To Install R:

- Open an internet browser and go to https://www.r-project.org/.
- Click the "download R" link in the middle of the page under "Getting Started."
- Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link e.g. the site provided by [Imperial College London](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/).
- Click on the "Download R for Windows" link, or the relevant link for your operating system (macOS, Linux). 
- Click on 'base' and then `Download R [Version Number] for Windows`. The current version is 4.1.1. 
- Once downloaded, double click the application file (.exe) and follow the installation instructions.

## R Studio

While R is now installed, it is good practice to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to access and run R functions. The most well known IDE for R is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which includes a console, higher quality graphics, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

**Note**: R may be used without RStudio, but RStudio cannot be used without R. 

To Install RStudio:

- Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and click on `Download RStudio for Windows`. Installers for macOS and other operating systems are available below.
