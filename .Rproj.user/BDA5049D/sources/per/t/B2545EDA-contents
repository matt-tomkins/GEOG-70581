# Set up {#Introduction}

During this practical you will be using R and WhiteboxTools (Geospatial Analysis Tools), an open-source GIS software package for hydro-geomorphic applications. This programme has much of the functionality found in a standard GIS software package, but it has a number of useful features specific to hydrological analysis, and it is relatively easy to install, with small file sizes.

Whitebox can be freely installed on a personal computer (https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/Whitebox/) although this requires ~100 Mb of disk storage to install. In addition, as Whitebox utilises the Java platform, your computer will need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8.0 or higher installed and operating. You can check your Java version using command prompt (see below) and by typing “java -version”. If you JRE version is less than 8.0 (e.g. java version “1.6.0”), you can update it here: https://www.java.com/en/download/. 

To Install R:

- Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org.
- Click the "download R" link in the middle of the page under "Getting Started."
- Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link.
- Click on the "Download R for Windows" link.
- Click on 'base' and then "Download R Version Number for Windows" (Current is 4.1.1)
- Click on the file containing the latest version of R under "Files."
- Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions.

Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio.

To Install RStudio:

- Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the "Download RStudio" button.
- Click on "Download RStudio Desktop."
- Click on the version recommended for your system, save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it to open, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder.
